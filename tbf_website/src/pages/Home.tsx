Last month, we ran a stall at the Millenium School, Noida, partnering with the Kitaab Club to raise funds and donate food. Another recent initiative was a 3 day drive, â€˜Nadaaniyanâ€™ in collaboration with Project Sukh, where we distributed over 300 meals. We also hosted a summer camp for the children living in the slums of Delhi, teaching them first aid, conducting a good & bad touch workshop and much more!"
